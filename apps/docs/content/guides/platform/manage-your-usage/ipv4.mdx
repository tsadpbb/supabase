## What you are charged for
It is possible to assign a dedicated IPv4 address to a database by enabling the [IPv4 add-on](/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address). You are charged for the IPv4 addresses configured for all your databases.

<Admonition type="note">
  If the primary database has a dedicated IPv4 address configured, its Read Replicas are also assigned one, with charges for each.
</Admonition>

## How charges are calculated
IPv4 addresses are charged by the hour, meaning you are charged for the exact number of hours that an IPv4 address is assigned to a database. If an address is assigned for part of an hour, you are still charged for the full hour.

### Example
Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. On January 10 at 4:30 PM, you enable the IPv4 add-on for your project. At the end of the billing cycle you are billed for 512 hours of IPv4.

| Time Window                                 | IPv4 add-on | Hours Billed | Description         |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| January 1, 00:00 AM - January 10, 4:00 PM   | Disabled    | 0            |                     |
| January 10, 04:00 PM - January 10, 4:30 PM  | Disabled    | 0            |                     |
| January 10, 04:30 PM - January 10, 5:00 PM  | Enabled     | 1            | full hour is billed |
| January 10, 05:00 PM - January 31, 23:59 PM | Enabled     | 511          |                     |


### Usage on your invoice
IPv4 usage is shown as "IPv4 Hours" on your invoice.

## Pricing
1 hour is $0.0055 ($4 per month).
