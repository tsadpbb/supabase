## What you are charged for
You are charged for the number of distinct images transformed during the billing period, regardless of how many transformations each image undergoes. We refer to these images as **origin** images.

**Example:** If you apply four different size transformations to one image and a single transformation to another, the total count is two, as only two origin images were transformed.

## How charges are calculated
Storage Image Transformations are billed using Package pricing, with each package representing 1000 origin images. If your usage falls between two packages, you are billed for the next whole package.

### Example
For simplicity, let's assume a package size of 5 and a charge of $2 per package.

| Number Of Origin Images | Number Of Packages Billed | Costs |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| 4                       | 1                         | $2    |
| 5                       | 1                         | $2    |
| 6                       | 2                         | $4    |

### Usage on your invoice

## Billing examples
### Within quota
The organization's number of origin images for the billing cycle is within the quota, so no charges apply.

| Line Item             | Units     | Costs   |
|-----------------------|-----------|---------|
| Pro Plan              | 1         | $25     |
| Compute Hours Micro   | 744 hours | $10     |

| **Total**             |           | **$25** |

### Exceeding quota
The organization's number of origin images for the billing cycle exceeds the quota by 750, incurring charges for this additional usage.
